# x86-emulator
Oh look, it's another repository! What's lyam doing now... emulating a whole instruction set, that's what
yeah after the summer im going to limit myself to one repository creation per month this is getting out of hand
those of you who follow me im sorry (not)

## files
All files inputted should be in hexadecimal, in ELF format. The emulator will go through all the bytes and execute it. As with any ELF file, there needs to be an ELF header (at the start) and then a number of section headers. To start with however, only the program section header will be implemented, but at some point it will all work. In the input file, you can put comments with the `#` symbol, like in Python. The rest of the line starting from where the `#` is will not be read by the emulator.

## what's implemented so far
i bet you're expecting something here
